 * lapse the failure is silent. A webhook needs none of that — it is one POST to
 * a URL, free on every Slack plan, and it lands where the team already is.
 *
 * Email and Slack are independent. Configure either, both, or neither; each
 * checks its own configuration and stays quiet if it is missing.
