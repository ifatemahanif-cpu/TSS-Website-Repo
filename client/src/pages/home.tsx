/**
 * THE HOMEPAGE, AS A SCORE.
 *
 * Six acts in order, and the order is the argument:
 *
 *   the Shaping   a sentence cuts itself down to what it means
 *   the turn      the belief underneath the work, on near-black
 *   the peak      the three people, on the only light ground
 *   the work      five cases, panned sideways, with the proof in them
 *   what we do    the offer, as three stages and eighteen things
 *   the close     the page stops moving and starts responding
 *
 * Every one of them is an <Act> and publishes its own ground so the fixed nav
 * can pick its ink. Nothing here decides anything; the acts do.
 */

/**
 * Arriving at an act by name — `/#act-peak` from any other page's footer.
 *
 * Not left to the browser, and not done once. Every act is sized in `svh` and
 * set in a webfont, so the offset of the fourth one is not known until the
 * fonts have swapped in and each stage has taken its real height. A single
 * scroll on mount lands short by however much the page grew afterwards.
 *
 * So it scrolls, then scrolls again when the fonts report ready, and gives up
 * the moment the reader touches anything — a page that keeps yanking itself
 * back is worse than one that lands a few hundred pixels off.
 *
 * `#case-*` is not ours: Work.tsx opens the reader on those, and its own scroll
 * handling is what puts the rail behind it.
