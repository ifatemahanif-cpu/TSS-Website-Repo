/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LLP Act 2008 s.21 compliance — statutory, not cosmetic. Every LLP's
 * "invoices, official correspondence and publications" must carry: (a) the
 * LLP's name, (b) the address of its registered office, (c) its LLPIN, and
 * (d) a statement that it is registered with limited liability. A public T&C
 * page behind a ₹25,000 payment is squarely a "publication".
 *
 * All four are present: clause 1 (all four), clause 17 (name + LLPIN +
 * address, for service of notice) and the page footer (all four).
 * LLPIN ACW-3552, supplied by Fatema 13 Aug 2026. If it ever changes, those
 * are the three places.
 *
 * NOTE on spelling: the registered address says "Bangalore" because that is
 * how the LLP is registered; clause 19 says "Bengaluru" via GOVERNING_CITY.
 * Both are correct. Do not harmonise them.

      "These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern the website design, copywriting and development engagement offered by The Story Shapers Collective LLP, a limited liability partnership registered in India under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 with LLP identification number ACW-3552 and registered with limited liability, whose registered office is at 15, Raam Durg, 3rd Main, Jayamahal Extension, Benson Town, Bangalore – 560046, Karnataka, India (“The Story Shapers”, “we”, “us”), under its August 2026 Independence Day offer (the “Offer”) to the person or entity that applies for and confirms a slot (the “Client”, “you”).",
      "Submitting an application is not a booking, and we are not obliged to accept it. The alignment call commits neither of us. A contract to deliver the Offer comes into existence only when we confirm a slot to you in writing and your booking fee reaches us in cleared funds, as set out in clause 5.",
      "From that point, these Terms and the written scope note issued after the alignment call together form the whole agreement between us. Where the scope note and these Terms conflict, the scope note prevails on matters of scope alone, for that engagement only, and only where you have confirmed it in writing. The scope note cannot change the fee, the refund position, the intellectual property terms, the limits on our liability or the governing law. Those change only by a written amendment under clause 20.",
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "2. The Offer",
    body: [
      "The Offer comprises: website copywriting; design and development of a website of up to five (5) pages; mobile-responsive implementation; meta and Open Graph tags; analytics installation; image compression; and functional contact or enquiry forms. We test what we deliver on the release versions current at your kickoff date of Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge, on desktop, and on current iOS and Android devices.",
      "“Website copywriting” means writing and editing the copy that appears on the pages we build for you, shaped from the information, materials and answers you supply. Working out what the website should say is part of it, and is what the alignment call and our questions are for.",
      "It does not include: brand strategy, positioning or messaging work produced as a standalone deliverable; naming of any kind, including company, product, service or campaign names; market, category or competitor research; case studies, whitepapers, blog articles or other long-form content; or copy for anything other than the website itself, such as decks, brochures, email campaigns, advertising or social media.",
      "We write from what you give us. Where the information you supply is not enough for us to write a page properly, we will tell you in writing and ask for more; we are not obliged to research, source or invent it, and time spent waiting for it is a delay on your side for the purposes of clause 6. Clause 8 sets out your responsibility for the accuracy of what you supply.",
      "₹80,000 (Indian Rupees eighty thousand) is the complete professional fee payable to The Story Shapers for the included scope. Third-party costs and excluded services described in these Terms are not included. If our tax registration position changes later, the fee for slots already confirmed does not change.",
      "“Up to five pages” is a ceiling, not a target. If your website needs fewer, the fee is the same, and unused pages cannot be carried forward, exchanged for other work, or given to anyone else.",
      "The Offer is limited to five (5) Clients, and to one website for one brand each. A slot covers a single brand. Where you own or operate more than one brand, business or trading name, each requires its own slot at its own fee, and a single website covering several brands is outside the Offer. Applications close at 23:59 IST on 31 August 2026. That is the date by which a slot must be confirmed, not the date by which websites are delivered. A slot is personal to you and cannot be sold, transferred or shared.",
      "We run a limited number of builds at a time, so slots are scheduled in the order in which booking fees are received. Your kickoff date is confirmed in writing before you pay the booking fee. The ten (10) working days are then counted from the start of the clock described in clause 6, which follows your kickoff.",
      "We reserve the right to decline any application at our discretion, including after the alignment call, and to withdraw or modify the Offer for applications not yet confirmed. Withdrawal or modification will not affect slots already confirmed by payment.",

  {
    title: "3. Definition of a “page”",
    body: [
      "For the purposes of this engagement, a “page” means a single URL comprising a hero section and approximately three to four further content sections, with one primary call to action. The About page on storyshaperscollective.com is the agreed reference for scale, as that page appears on the date your slot is confirmed. We will record that reference in the scope note, so that neither of us later relies on a page that has since changed.",
      "Content materially exceeding this scale — for example an About page of approximately 3,000 words across six or more sections — will be counted as more than one page. Any such assessment will be made and communicated in writing during or immediately after the alignment call, before development begins.",
      "If the content you supply after that assessment grows beyond the agreed scale, we will tell you in writing before we build it. You may then trim it, or commission the additional page as separate work at separate cost.",

        "custom photography, videography, illustration or 3D work;",

        "search engine optimisation beyond the meta and Open Graph tags described in clause 2;",
        "integrations with third-party systems, such as CRMs, booking or scheduling tools and marketing automation;",
        "migration of an existing website, or of its content, from another platform;",
        "email hosting, mailbox setup and email deliverability configuration;",
        "privacy policies, terms of use, cookie notices and other legal or statutory text for your website;",

        "domain, hosting and third-party subscription costs, which are dealt with in clause 9;",
        "ongoing content production;",
        "paid media setup or management; and",
        "multilingual or localised versions of the website.",

  {
    title: "5. Fees, booking fee and payment",
    body: [
      "The total fee is ₹80,000 payable in Indian Rupees in two instalments: (a) a booking fee of ₹25,000 (Indian Rupees twenty-five thousand), and (b) the balance of ₹55,000 (Indian Rupees fifty-five thousand), payable before deployment, transfer or publication as set out below.",
      "A slot is confirmed only on receipt of the booking fee in cleared funds. A payment link will be issued after the alignment call. Slots are allocated in the order in which booking fees are received.",
      "The booking fee is credited in full against the total fee and is not an additional charge. It is payable in consideration of reserving production capacity for your engagement and the onboarding, planning and preparatory work that begins once your slot is confirmed. Except for the cancellation right expressly set out in clause 12, the booking fee is non-refundable if you cancel or do not proceed. This is because, once your slot is confirmed, we reserve writing, design and development capacity for you and may decline other work for that period.",
      "The balance of ₹55,000 falls due once the included scope and the included revision rounds have been completed, and is payable before deployment, transfer or publication of the website. We will notify you in writing when the completed website is ready for final review and deployment. “launch” means the date of that notification, whether or not you have then paid, approved or published the website. Where we cannot issue it because you have not provided the domain, hosting or access we asked for, launch is the date we notify you in writing that the website is finished and waiting on you.",
      "No final files, code repository, credentials, production deployment or transfer of intellectual property rights are provided until the balance reaches us in cleared funds, and no rights in the deliverables pass to you before then; see clause 10.",
      "Invoices are payable within seven (7) days of issue. Amounts unpaid after fourteen (14) days may attract simple interest at 1.5% per month, or the highest rate permitted by law if that is lower. While any amount is overdue we may suspend work, withhold deployment and withhold transfer of the deliverables, and no rights in them pass to you; see clause 10.",
      "Bank charges, gateway fees and, for international Clients, currency conversion costs are payable by you. Where you are required by law to deduct tax at source, you may deduct it from the amount payable and will issue the relevant certificate promptly; the amount deducted counts towards the fee and does not increase what you owe.",
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "6. Timeline and the working-days clock",
    body: [
      "Delivery is ten (10) working days from the start of the clock described below. Working days exclude weekends and public holidays observed by The Story Shapers in India. The ten working days are a commitment we make on the condition that you meet the response times in this clause. The clock does not run while we are waiting on you.",
      "The clock starts on the first working day after we receive all assets and information listed in the asset checklist issued at kickoff. It does not start on the date the booking fee is paid.",
      "We will confirm to you in writing that the checklist is complete and that the clock has started, and that written confirmation is the record of the start date and of the delivery date it produces. Where something on the checklist is outstanding, we will tell you what is missing, and the clock does not start until it reaches us.",
      "You agree to provide all assets within forty-eight (48) hours of kickoff and feedback at each review round within twenty-four (24) hours. Each working day of delay in providing assets, feedback or approvals extends the delivery date by an equivalent period, and where a delay costs us your production window, until the next window we are able to offer you. Delays exceeding ten (10) working days in aggregate entitle us to reschedule your slot to the next available window, and the ten-working-day delivery commitment then no longer applies to that engagement.",
      "The ten working days also exclude delay caused by third parties or by matters outside our reasonable control, including domain transfer and DNS propagation, hosting provisioning, platform, payment-gateway or app-store approvals, third-party service outages, and the turnaround times of any provider you have appointed. The delivery date extends by the length of the delay. This is separate from clause 14, which deals with events that prevent performance altogether.",
      // Lawyer's three-limb deemed-acceptance test, converted into the
      // document's register (you / deliverables / scope note) with Fatema's
      // approval, 13 Aug. Substance unchanged from her wording.
      "The deliverables will be deemed accepted on the earliest of: (a) your written approval; (b) your publication or use of any deliverable; (c) expiry of three working days after we notify you that the deliverables are ready for final review without you identifying a material non-conformity with the agreed scope note.",
      "A subjective preference, change of mind or request for work outside the agreed scope is not a material non-conformity.",
      "The engagement runs in stages, identified in the scope note and ordinarily copy, then design, then build. Each stage is approved before the next begins, and the test above applies to each stage as it does to the deliverables as a whole.",
      "An approved stage is closed. Work you have approved, or that has been treated as accepted, is not reopened by a later revision round. Returning to a closed stage is not a revision, does not draw on the rounds included in clause 7, and is additional work that will be quoted and agreed in writing before we undertake it. The delivery date extends accordingly.",
      "If a project is inactive on your side for thirty (30) consecutive days, we may treat the engagement as suspended, invoice for work completed to date, and require a fresh slot allocation to resume. Resumption is subject to our availability at the time and to our rates then in force; the Offer price does not survive suspension. If the engagement remains inactive for ninety (90) consecutive days we may treat it as closed by written notice, and clause 12 then applies as though you had cancelled.",

    title: "7. Revisions",
    body: [
      "The fee includes two (2) rounds of revisions on copy and one (1) round of revisions on design, counted across the website as a whole and not per page. A round means a single consolidated set of comments from your named decision-maker, sent at one time. Further comments that arrive after a round has been actioned count as the next round.",
      "A revision is a refinement within the agreed scope, direction and structure. A change of direction, structure, page count, positioning or brand approach after approval is not a revision and will be quoted separately. Additional rounds beyond those included are chargeable at our then-current rates, quoted to you and agreed in writing before the work is undertaken.",

You represent and warrant that you own, or have obtained all necessary rights, licences, releases, consents and permissions to allow us to use, reproduce, edit, adapt and publish every asset or piece of material you supply or instruct us to use. We are entitled to rely on that warranty and are not required to independently verify ownership or licensing.",

This does not apply to the extent the claim arises from our own breach of these Terms.",
      "If a third-party claim covered by this indemnity is made or threatened, we will notify you within a reasonable time after becoming aware of it and provide reasonable cooperation in responding to it. You will reimburse our reasonable costs, including legal costs, arising from the claim to the extent covered by the indemnity. Neither party may settle a claim in a manner that imposes liability, an admission or a continuing obligation on the other without that party's written consent.",

If the full fee is never paid, no rights pass to you and you may not use, publish, adapt or authorise anyone else to use the deliverables.",
      "Before payment in full, drafts and review versions may be supplied through password-protected, watermarked, restricted or non-production environments. We may restrict or withdraw access to those versions following cancellation or non-payment. You may not copy, reproduce, publish, deploy, adapt, instruct another provider to recreate, or otherwise use any unpaid deliverable or substantial part of it. Review access does not constitute delivery or transfer of ownership.",

We claim no rights in the material you supplied to us, which remains yours throughout, subject only to the licences you grant us in clauses 8 and 11.",

The source code repository forms part of what you have paid for: we will transfer it to you on written request, at no additional cost, within a reasonable time of that request. We are not obliged to retain a copy of it more than twelve (12) months after launch. Changes, additions and upgrades to the website after launch are new work under clause 7.",

Nothing in these Terms prevents us from reusing that pre-existing intellectual property on other engagements. Where any of it is embedded in what we deliver, you have a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use it as part of your website.",

We will not disclose your confidential commercial information in doing so.",

      "If you cancel after work has commenced, the booking fee remains non-refundable and will be applied towards the value of work undertaken. For this purpose, work is valued by reference to the stage the engagement has reached, including discovery and planning, copy development, design development and website development, and not merely by the number of pages completed. We will provide you with a written statement of the work completed. If the value of work completed exceeds the booking fee, we may invoice you for the difference, up to the total fee. No further work will be undertaken after cancellation.",

We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special or consequential loss, or for loss of profit, revenue, business, goodwill, data or anticipated savings.",
