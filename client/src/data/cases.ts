/**
 * THE CASE STUDIES.
 *
 * Copy lives here and nowhere else, so a change is one edit rather than a hunt
 * through markup. The shape is deliberately the shape of a CMS record — the
 * site still has no home for case studies (the ones on /work are hardcoded in
 * Work.tsx, and the per-person portfolios pull from a different table again),
 * and this is what that collection would look like if it existed. Fatema's
 * call: ship it as a checked-in file now, decide where case studies live later.
 *
 * Every figure is from the deck. Nothing here is invented; where a number was
 * not in the deck it is not on the page.
 *
 * `<i>…</i>` is the only markup allowed in these strings, for quoting what
 * somebody said. It is parsed by hand in RichText rather than passed to
 * dangerouslySetInnerHTML, because the day this becomes a real CMS table these
 * strings stop being ours.
