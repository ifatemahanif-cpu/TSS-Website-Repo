/**
 * The site footer.
 *
 * THE CLOSE IS THE INVITATION; THIS IS THE MAP. Every item here has to be
 * somewhere to GO. That is the rule the previous version broke.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT (Fatema, 25 Aug: "the footer is repeating the same
 * thing that's already there in the last section"). Measured rather than
 * argued, with live/footermap.mjs:
 *
 *   - a column headed START SOMETHING held two things. One was the email,
 *     printed 258px below the close's own print of it. The other was "Tell us
 *     your story" pointing at `#act-close` — a footer link that scrolls the
 *     reader BACKWARDS into the section they just left. It was the only item
 *     in the footer that was not a destination.
 *   - meanwhile SIX real pages had no link here at all: /team, /contact,
 *     /offer, and all three Shaper portfolios. The contact page is where the
 *     close's own button goes, and the three portfolios had exactly one route
 *     in from anywhere on the site — a card on /team.
 *   - and "The Shapers" pointed at `#act-peak` while the nav's "Team" pointed
 *     at `/team`. One idea, two destinations: from /blog the footer threw you
 *     to the homepage and scrolled instead of to the page about the team.
 *
 * So the third column stopped being a second call to action and became the
 * people, which is the one thing this site claims and the one thing that was
 * buried. The strapline directly above it says "you work with the people who
 * do the work"; these three pages are that sentence's evidence.
 *
 * THE ADDRESS STAYS, and it is the one repeat left. /contact is a form and
 * prints no address anywhere, so on the eight pages that have no close above
 * them this is the only place the email exists. It moved out of a column with
 * a heading over it — which is what made it read as a second ask — and sits
 * under the logo as what it is, contact information rather than a pitch.
 *
 * ON EVERY PAGE, NOT JUST THE HOMEPAGE. It began as home-only, which left
 * /our-story, /blog, /join, /contact and every article ending in nothing at all
 * — and on a phone, where the bar had no menu either, that was a page with no
 * way off it.
 *
 * Which makes the in-page links the one thing to be careful about. "The work"
 * is an act on the homepage rather than a route of its own, so it is
 * `#act-proof` while you are standing on it and `/#act-proof` when you are
 * not. Home reads that hash on arrival — see pages/home.tsx.
