 *
 * ON A PHONE THE RAIL STOPS BEING A RAIL.
 *
 * The card pitch is 328px against a 375px screen and the pan is linear with no
 * snapping, so where a card comes to rest is purely a function of where a thumb
 * stops — measured mid-word truncation at every sampled position ("no consistent

 * ordinary vertical stack, and so does reduced motion, where a 2865px row inside
 * a 1440px stage left cards three to five reachable only through a horizontal
 * scrollbar nobody had been told about.

/**
 * THE BRANDS, INSIDE THE WORK.
 *
 * This was a section of its own between the rail and the services, and it read
 * as exactly that: a strip nobody had introduced, sitting in the gap between two
 * things that did belong. Fatema's word was orphaned. It is a footnote to the
 * work, so it is a footnote to the work — pinned to the bottom of this act's own
 * frame, under a rule, while the cards pan above it.
 *
 * A marquee, in type, at the site's own weights. No logo wall: nine grey
 * trademarks at nine different optical weights is the least designed thing a
 * page like this can do, and half of them would need permission we do not have.
 *
 * With motion off it becomes an ordinary wrapped list. A strip that never stops
 * moving is the single worst thing on a page for anyone who asked for stillness.
