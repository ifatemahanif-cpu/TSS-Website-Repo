/**
 * THE PEAK — three people, met one at a time, then together.
 *
 * The only light ground on the page and the only faces on it. Everything before
 * this is type on navy; the cut to bone is the loudest thing the page does, and
 * it is spent on the one claim the business actually rests on.
 *
 * WHY THE PANELS WIPE AND DO NOT FADE
 *
 * Fading two full-screen layers through each other put a two-eyed portrait on
 * the screen with "Shaili Contractor" and "Aakanksha Singh Devi" on one baseline
 * and both bios interleaved — a fifth of a thumb swipe, sitting on the climax of
 * the page. Making the layers opaque does NOT fix it: a layer that is fading in
 * is translucent while it does so, whatever is painted on it, so the one beneath
 * still reads through. Any opacity cross-fade between two full-bleed layers
 * shows both.
 *
 * A clip wipe never does. Every pixel belongs to exactly one panel at every
 * moment, and an edge travelling across the frame suits a typographic poster
 * better than a dissolve anyway.
 *
 * THE STACK IS THE MECHANISM
 *
 * Four opaque layers that only ever rise: intro at z-1, the three panels at z-2,
 * the convergence at z-4. The intro is COVERED rather than cross-faded — fading
 * it out under a half-opaque panel put its sentence through Fatema's name.
 *
 * WHERE THE COPY LIVES
 *
 * Here, not in the CMS. The CMS team records carry `whatSheBrings` and
 * `decisionsLed`, and the lines below are a rewrite of both that Fatema approved
 * on the study — wiring this to the CMS today would put the older, longer copy
 * back on the page. The portraits are the same story: these are purpose-cut at
 * 4:5 with a chosen focus point, and the CMS holds one 2MB uncropped JPEG and
 * one 800x800. Re-wiring is a decision for after the rework lands, and it needs
 * the CMS rows updated first.
 */

/**
 * `focus` is the vertical object-position of the panel photograph, and it is not
 * a taste knob — it is the only thing standing between the phone layout and a
 * headless torso.
 *
 * The phone picture box is landscape and the photographs are 4:5, so
 * object-cover fills the width and crops the height — and left to itself it
 * crops from the CENTRE, which is a band through the middle of a standing
 * portrait. Aakanksha's arrived as her waist, Shaili's cut at the eyes.
 *
 * The three photographs are framed differently enough that no single value
 * serves all of them: Shaili's and Aakanksha's heads start at the top of their
 * frames, Fatema's a fifth of the way down.
 *
 * It costs nothing on a wide screen. At lg the box is 42% x 100svh, TALLER than
 * 4:5, so the crop runs horizontally and the vertical value is inert.
