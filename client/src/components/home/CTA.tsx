/**
 * THE CLOSE — the page stops moving and starts responding.
 *
 * Three doors, deliberately: the button goes to the form, for people who would
 * rather be asked the right questions, and the two routes under the rule are for
 * people who just want to send a message. It used to be one door dressed as two
 * — a button that quietly opened a mail client, above a footer carrying the same
 * address.
 *
 * WHY THIS FRAME IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS
 *
 * Fatema's note on the study: it looked empty. It was, measurably — 358px of
 * content in a 900px stage, 40% of its own frame, with the heading at 70px
 * against the hero's settled 128px. The last frame of the film was reading at
 * half the weight of the first. Three corrections, none of which invented copy:
 *
 *   1. the heart moved INSIDE the sentence, after the full stop, sized in `em`.
 *      Floating above a centred block it read as a thing in a gap, which was
 *      also her note on the hero's wink before that one was cut outright.
 *      This one stays: the hero's sentence had just finished cutting itself to
 *      three words and a face after the full stop was a second punchline. This
 *      heading is an invitation, and the heart is the warmth on an ask.
 *   2. the heading came up to within striking distance of the hero.
 *   3. `.close__who` under a hairline: the peak's three faces at 2.6rem, then
 *      the direct routes. The faces carry no caption on purpose; the peak
 *      introduced them three screens earlier, so at this size they are a
 *      signature rather than a second team section.
 *
 * The stage is 76svh rather than a full screen, so the footer's top edge is
 * inside the frame and the last thing you see has a bottom to it.
