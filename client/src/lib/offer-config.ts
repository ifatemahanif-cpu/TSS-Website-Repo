 * TESTIMONIALS
 *
 * ⚠️  READ THIS. Every quote below is FABRICATED. Written by an AI as a
 * design placeholder so the section could be built and reviewed. Not one of
 * these people exists. Not one of these sentences was said by a client.
 *
 * Publishing invented testimonials on a page that collects a ₹25,000 deposit
 * is a misleading-advertising problem, not a copy problem — ASCI's guidelines
 * and the CCPA's rules on fake reviews both bite here, and it's the kind of
 * thing a competitor or an unhappy applicant can screenshot.
 *
 * So the section is gated. While TESTIMONIALS_APPROVED is false it renders
 * with a visible "PLACEHOLDER" ribbon over it. Replace the quotes with real,
 * permissioned ones and flip the flag — or delete <Testimonials /> from
 * client/src/pages/offer.tsx and ship without the section.
 *
 * Do NOT flip the flag to silence the ribbon. It is doing its job.
